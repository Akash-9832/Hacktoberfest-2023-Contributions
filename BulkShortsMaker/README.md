# BulkShortsMaker
A program made using Python which can create multiple Shots/Reels at once!

## Why did I make this?
Well basically theres this feature by canva pro called [Bulk Create](https://www.canva.com/en_in/help/bulk-create/), which is exclusively a PRO feature, so when I made this project, I did not have Canva Pro, and I didn't wanted to buy it :p

#### Soo this was my creation in order to get a Canva Pro feature for free :)
